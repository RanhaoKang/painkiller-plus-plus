Updates
-------------

October 10th 2014

 - Added autoexec.ini
	 - autoexec.ini WILL NOT be overwritten
	 - create autoexec.ini in your Painkiller/Bin/ directory, it will exec automatically on game start
 - /exec (insert_config_name).ini in console no longer overwrites config :)
 - Slabs are now loaded in multiplayer, they are a bit buggy for some things, but basic functionality is there.
 - Enforcing maxfps of 125 (PK++ 1.3 did it, so will we...?)
 - **Race Mode**!
	 - Still has bugs but functions in it's basic form
	 - Not fully functional
	 - Players are "ghosts" to other players
		 - Explosions still affect other players, not sure if we can change this (boo closed source projects)
	 - Rockets, Stakes, Grenades, and other Projectile ammo will go 'through' other players
	 - Only one person can "race" at a time
	 - /kill respawns flag
	 - updated RACE_Psycho
 - /callvote map race_* now longer throws an error
 - DM_Amphi_11 included thanks to Stebe! o/
